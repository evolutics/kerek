# Wheelsticks: Zero-downtime deployments for Docker Compose

Docker Compose offers simple, declarative orchestration of containerized apps.

When updating a service container with Docker Compose, the old container is
stopped _before_ a new container is started. This causes a service interruption
(unless the service is replicated).

To achieve a zero-downtime deployment instead, you can use Wheelsticks.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Docker or Podman
- Docker Compose

### Build

Pre-compiled executables are coming soon, until then run

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/evolutics/wheelsticks.git
```

The built executable is installed into the folder `~/.cargo/bin` by default.

### Docker CLI plugin

Coming soon for integration with the familiar Docker CLI.

## Usage

### Quick start

1. For services whose container lifetimes should overlap during an update,
   configure their update order like so:

   ```yaml
   services:
     web:
       image: â€¦
       deploy:
         update_config:
           order: start-first # Most important line.
   ```

   While this follows the
   [Compose specification](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/blob/master/deploy.md#update_config),
   support for `start-first` is optional: plain Docker Compose ignores it,
   always using `stop-first` instead.

1. In order to seamlessly switch traffic from an old to a new container during a
   deployment, you need to use something like a reverse proxy.

1. Now each time you update your services, simply run

   ```bash
   wheelsticks deploy
   ```

### Demo

See the [`example`](example) folder for a demo. You can play with it as follows:

```
cd example
docker compose up --detach
curl localhost:8080

# Deploy an update:
HI_VERSION=B wheelsticks deploy

# Deploy another update:
HI_VERSION=C wheelsticks deploy
```

Note how the service at localhost:8080 is always available, even during
deployments.

You can clean up with `docker compose down`.
